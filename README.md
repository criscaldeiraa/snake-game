# snake-game

A snake game is a simple game where a snake moves around a box trying to eat an apple. Once it successfully eats the apple, the length of the snake increases and the movement becomes faster.

Then the game is over when the snake runs into itself or any of the four walls of the box.


## Why I am building this game?
Because it was one of my favorites to play in my grandmother's phone.
I always loved this game, and it is always a challenge to play :)
